# data-seri
#### Manifesto

Because *Human* is **perfectible** and **error-prone**, because *Science* should be **open** and **flow** and because *cogito ergo sum*.

Goal
----
This is the repository containing the SERI dataset and the necessary code to plug the data into [protoclass](https://github.com/glemaitre/protoclass).

Status
------
At this moment, the full content of this repository is unavailable while we get the full approval form the ethic’s committee.
Meanwhile, do *not acetate* to contact us to get access to the data.

There is an open discussion on different manners of sharing the dataset [here](https://github.com/I2Cvb/data-seri/issues/1)

Data Description
----------------

This dataset was acquired by the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), using CIRRUS TM (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc., Dublin, CA) SD-OCT device. The dataset
consists of 32 OCT volumes (16 DME and 16 normal cases). Each volume
contains 128 B-scan with resolution of 512 $\times$ 1024 pixels.  All
SD-OCT images are read and assessed by trained graders and identified as
normal or DME cases based on evaluation of retinal thickening, hard
exudates, intraretinal cystoid space formation and subretinal fluid.

Work using this dataset (up to our knowledge)
